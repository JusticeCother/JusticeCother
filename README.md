- 👋 Hi, I’m @JusticeCother
- 👀 I’m interested in coding games and machine learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#
- 💞️ I’m interested in collaboration but not currently as I am still building my skills to be worthy of a team and carry my own weight.
- 📫 You can reach me here on GitHub for now, I don't see any reason to put any other sources of contact at the moment.
